# space-invasion

\*\*\*What to do next

6.invadores should come in different shapes/color each level
7.the game must start slow and become faster each level. levels change after 20 invaders killed
8.for some reason there are 2 restart buttons
9.implement some cool features like: exploding invaders, invaders giving extra bullets/lives, invaders taking bullets/lives
10.maybe find a cool svg machine gun
11.change the color of the field each level
12.create a window showing that the level has changed
13.optimize the interval process - the function is too long and complicated
