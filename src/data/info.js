  <h3>The gun</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>
     Use right and left arrows on the keyboard to move the gun.
  </li>
  <li>
     Use Space button to shoot. You can shoot single bullets or, if you keep pressing the button, you can shoot in rows.
  </li>
    </ul>
  <h3>The Invaders</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
    The invaders  change shape, color and speed every level.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>The Strangers</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>
  The strangers are three randomly falling entities: first-aid-kig, bomb and bullet cartridge.
  </li>
  <li>
  The first-aid-kit, if shot, gives you one extra life.
  </li>
  <li>
  The bomb, if shot, takes one life from you but also destroys all the invaders present on the board. It doesn't stop new invaders from appearing.
  </li>
  <li>
  The bullet cartridge gives you 100 extra bullets.
  </li>
  <li>
  If you don't shoot any of the strangers, they just fall through the floor not affecting the game in any way.
  </li>
  </ul>
